# Machine Learning 2: Using Advanced Machine Learning Models

What happens when you encounter large data sets that are more nuanced than a set of concrete numbers? When you begin to explore natural language, or data sets with many potential influential features, you require more complex and predictive machine learning models. In this advanced Data Science workshop, learn about K-Means, Naive Bayes, and Regression models that will better support complex data and questions.

You do not need any prior experience with data science to attend this workshop. You are likely someone who is interested in data science, and has 1-2 years coding in Python, or another programming language and feel comfortable enough with Python to be able to code in it during the workshop. You are interested in learning about how to prepare your data for advanced machine learning models using Python and specific Python libraries.

## Engagement Expectations

This workshop is meant to be highly interactive. The instructor will lead you in two interactive teaching styles:

1. **Interactive Lecturing:** The majority of content for this workshop is in a Notebook. Though the content will be introduced via PowerPoint, the rest of the workshop will consist of walking them through the Azure Notebooks. During this time, instructors will employ an interactive lecture style, where learners will be asked to participate by asking questions and offering up ideas.

2. **Think, Pair, Share:** For some of the more complex topics, the instructor will use the "Think, Pair, Share" method. This is where you will be asked a question and given about 45 seconds to think quietly to yourself. During this time it is imperative that you are not discussing with others yet. Then, you will have an opportunity to disucss with the 1-2 people next to you. Make sure you don't just share your answer, but *why* you think that is the answer. Finally, the isntructor will ask for a few people to share what they discussed with their neighbors. 

*Notice*: Various interactive cues are called out in the Notebooks. These are suggestions and at the instructor's discression.
