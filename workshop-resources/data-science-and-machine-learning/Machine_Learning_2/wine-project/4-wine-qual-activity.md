## Classification and Linear Regression - Wine Quality Predictor

Contoso Farm Data Systems is opening a new line products for the wine makers of the world. The goal of Contessa’s newest efforts is to develop an application that can predict the quality of wine based on a number of factors. Additionally, they have a small dataset of wine data that they would like to be sorted into different classifications.

In this project you will do both regression and classification tasks on this data. It will test your understanding in different fields – outlier detection, feature selection, and unbalanced data. There are 4898 rows and 12 columns in this dataset.
