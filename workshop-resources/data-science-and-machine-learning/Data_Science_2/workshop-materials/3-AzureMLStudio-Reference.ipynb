        "Thus far, we have looked at building and fitting ML models “locally.” True, the notebooks have been located in the cloud themselves, but the models with all of their predictive and classification power are stuck in those notebooks. To use these models, you would have to load data into your notebooks and get the results there.\n",

        "In practice, we want those models accessible from a number of locations. And while the management of production ML models has a lifecycle all its own, one part of that is making models accessible from the web. One way to do so is to develop them using third-party cloud tools, such as [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning](https://ml.azure.com/).\n",

        "Additionally, we've so far only run one machine learning algorithm on each dataset at a time. In addition to the Cloud, Azure Machine Learning also offers `AutoML`: Automated Machine Learning. AutoML is a service where Azure will run the data through many machine learning algorithms and determine which algorithm more accurately classifies customers. "
