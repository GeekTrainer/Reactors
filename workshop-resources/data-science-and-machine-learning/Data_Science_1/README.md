# Introduction to Python for Data Science

Data enables us to understand the world around us. Whether we're gathering 
data about our natural world to understand how it is changing, or analyzing 
patterns in how societies grow and change to ensure we're supporting all 
people, data is what drives the conversation. In this one-day workshop, we 
invite you to take the first step to learning how to understand data. With 
the power of Python, you will be able to explore data more quickly and 
develop more complex learnings from that data with just a few lines of code. 
Step 1: Learn the basics of Python coding and understand how it can be used 
to digest large data sets.

## Engagement Expectations
This workshop is meant to be highly interactive. The instructor will lead you in 
two interactive teaching styles:
1. **Interactive Lecturing:** The majority of content for this workshop is in a 
Notebook. Though the content will be introduced via PowerPoint, the rest of the 
workshop will consist of walking them through the Azure Notebooks. During this time, 
instructors will employ an interactive lecture style, where learners will be asked to 
participate by asking questions and offering up ideas.
2. **Think, Pair, Share:** For some of the more complex topics, the instructor will 
use the "Think, Pair, Share" method. This is where you will be asked a question and 
given about 45 seconds to think quietly to yourself. During this time it is imperative 
that you are not discussing with others yet. Then, you will have an opportunity to 
disucss with the 1-2 people next to you. Make sure you don't just share your answer, 
but *why* you think that is the answer. Finally, the isntructor will ask for a few 
people to share what they discussed with their neighbors. 

*Notice*: Various interactive cues are called out in the Notebooks. These are 
suggestions and at the instructor's discression.
