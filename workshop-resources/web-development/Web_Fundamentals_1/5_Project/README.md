# Web Fundamentals 1 Project

## Background

Contoso offers high resolution 3D printing services. The company is able to print custom designs in a variety of materials and finishes. Customers only need to upload a file, customize the order, add shipping and payment information to place an order. As a member of the development team, a designer has supplied a mock up to be implemented by you, the web developer.

## Key Concepts

- Web Development Process
- Identify page layouts by breaking down page into sections

## Accessiblity

The web was designed to be avilable for everyone regardless of their condition. Not everyone can access the web the same way. Depending on the situation, a user could have a permanent, temporary, or conditional disability. A user could be accessing the web through various devices, connection speeds, and locations that could affect their experience on the web. In some cases accessibility for all is required by law. In order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities, it is important as developers to keep accessibility in mind when developing applications. It is up to you the developer to make the web an accessible place.

Some tips to get started on building a more accessible web:

- Use semantic html
- Use alt tags to describe an image `<img src="" alt="Image description goes here">`
- Add caption tags `<caption></caption>` to tables
- Use keyboard navigation
- Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) properties to define roles for objects

## Ethics

Here are some questions to think about:

- What kind of materials are being used in the product?
- Do these products need warning labels?
- What is the environmental impact of these products depending on the material being use?
- Are there any file types that should be prohibited such as weapons?

## The Web Development Proccess

Web development is an iterative process that is repeated throughout the lifetime of a product. The process can be broken down into the following steps:

> Design -> Develop -> Deploy -> Iterate

1. Design - Generate a blueprint for the work to be done
2. Develop - Write necessary code to implement the design
3. Deploy - Push code to a server to be viewed by anyone
4. Iterate - Repeat as necessary

### Design

Depending on the size of the team, the developer can also play the role of the designer. In some larger teams there is a dedicated designer for the product.

- [ ] gather requirements and assets (wireframe)
- [ ] ask questions if something is unclear before writing code
- [ ] create plan (implement top to bottom)

### Develop

Create a good foundation by focusing on the structural html before apply any CSS. HTML is equivalent to the bones in our body in the sense that it helps hold everything together, without it we cannot hold form. CSS can then be applied on top of a solid HTML foundation to add the final touches. A common developer mistake is too try to fix layout issues with CSS first, which can lead more difficult to maintain code.

- [ ] idenify layout and repeating patterns (to be used for clasification)
- [ ] create the necessary files (index.html, main.css)
- [ ] code section by section focusing on the html structure first using common body tags as duscussed in [Part 2. HTML: Common Body Tags](../2_HTML/common_body_tags.md) and forms from [Part 2. HTML: Forms](../2_HTML/forms.md)
- [ ] add style to get layout to match mockup using CSS Selectors as disccussed in [Part 3. CSS: CSS Selectors](../3_CSS_CSS3/css_selectors.md)
- [ ] continue building the page by styling elements or text, as discussed in [Part 3. CSS: Styling Elements](../3_CSS_CSS3/styling_elements.md) and [Part 3. CSS: Styling Text](../3_CSS_CSS3/styling_text.md)

### Deploy

What does it mean to deploy code? In summary, our code is to be copied to a server and will be sent to clients as discussed in [Part 1. Web Basics: The Request and Response Cycle](../1_Web_Basics/req_resp.md)

- [Checkout a live version of the site](https://reactor1.z5.web.core.windows.net)
- Follow deployment instructions from [Part 4. Capstone Deployment](../4_Capstone_Deployment/deploy.md)

### Iterate

Depending on the length of the project a developer might also get the task of maintaining the application over a period of time. During this maintenance one can expect to see the following kind of tasks:

- Add new features
- Add new pages
- A/B Testing different colors / user flows

---

## Key Takeaways

- Review requirements before coding
- Break pages into manageable sections

## Bonus

- Improve User Experience by break steps into multiple pages so users don't have to scroll
- Add cost calculation to order
- Add about and contact pages
