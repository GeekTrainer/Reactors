# Microsoft Reactor Workshops

**Update:** Due to the concerns surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, we have temporarily suspended programming and events in all Reactor locations as the health and safety of our community and employees is our top priority. We are now offering online learning opportunities for our current content. For more information about online events refer to:
